Besides helping my friends, this data science solution will help tour operators and other tourist-related businesses when designing tourist packages and providing advice to their clients. \n\n### Data\n\n1. I will first generate a neighborhood dataset along with their latitude and longitude values for a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. \n\n2. I will then leverage the Foursquare API to explore the neighborhoods and segment them according to the types of venues in each neighborhood. \n\n3. Next I will cluster the neighborhoods into an optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. \n\n4. For each resulting cluster, I will calculate the average user ratings for restaurants of the categories favoured by my friends, along with the top 5 rated restaurant. \n\n5. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters. This visual exploration will allow me to generate a final recommended itinerary for each of the three days my friends. \n",
